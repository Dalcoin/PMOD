*Scripting modules in python to make life easier*

The purpose of this directory is twofold: 

1. A repository for the PMOD package. 

2. A repository for scripts which have been developed 
   with heavy dependence upon PMOD.


## 1.) The PMOD Package

**Description**: The "PMOD" python module contains functions for facilitating research work (File I/O, formatting and automation). This package is not intended to replace built-in functions, or popular packages where applicible. Rather, it is intended to extend upon the built in functionality found in the standard Python release and increase productivity in the course of work which involves the generating/processing/presentation of numeric data.

**List of python files in PMOD**:

1. cmdline.py
2. cmdutil.py
3. ioparse.py
4. mathops.py
5. opti.py
6. phelp.py
7. pinax.py
8. strlist.py
9. tcheck.py
10. zkparse.py

### Version : 4.0 

## Contents

The PMOD Package currently contains 10 Modules

Each Modules contains related functions and classes which are designed to optimize performance for a specific task.


## 2.) script_applications 

**Description**: scripts using PMOD module functionality
